I am currently in the first year of [STOR-i CDT](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/stor-i/) at Lancaster University. Previously, I did BSc Mathematics and Statistical Science at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/maths/) where I was mentored by [Sam Livingstone](https://samueljlivingstone.wixsite.com/webpage).

I am broadly interested in computational statistics.

Very interesting article by E Weinan: "[The Dawning of a New Era in Applied Mathematics](files/new_era.pdf)".
