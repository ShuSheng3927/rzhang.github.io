It was early 2021 when I first visited the British Museum. I was in my first year of undergraduate at UCL, and it was the middle stage of covid where lockdowns were on and off. It was a confusing time to most, and especially to me, as I was in between the discomfort of moving to a new country in a foreign continent, the uncertainties in an increasingly precarious world, and the urge for a sensible life plan. 

My first visit was on a cloudy afternoon, rather typical weather for London during that time of the year. Few visitors were in the museum, and the ones there were subconsciously maintaining some distance from each other. The enlightenment gallery was the last stop of my visit that time, and I was exhausted, mentally and physically, from walking nonstop for two hours and seeing countless artefacts. 

The curtains of the gallery were loosely pulled down, allowing the afternoon sun to permeate through. The long hallway - with seemingly endless shelves of books extending from the floor to the ceiling on the two sides- was bright enough to display its overwhelming wealth and dim enough to remain mysteriously noble. It was stunning. I walked towards the middle of the gallery and sat on a bench. Mesmerised by the weight of intellectual history. 

Since then, I have been back to the museum and that same enlightenment gallery numerous times, yet I could never recreate that same astonishment. Maybe I would never be in that same mental space, for better or for worse, and maybe the museum would never be that empty again, to leave me alone with the artefacts and the history.
