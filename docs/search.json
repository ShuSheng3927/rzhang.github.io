My PhD project looks at Bayesian experiment design for ocean currents predictions, and is in collaboration with TIDE. My supervisors are Henry Moss and David Leslie at Lancaster, as well as Lachlan Astfalck and Edward Cripps at UWA.\nPreviously, I did BSc Mathematics and Statistical Science at UCL where I was mentored by Sam Livingstone and received a Royal Statistical Society Award.\nI am broadly interested in computational statistics and machine learning methodologies, and their applications in science and health related topics. See here for more information.\nI am currently co-organising the BayesAI Workshop."

In particular, I am interested in (1) developing methodologies with strong relevance to applications, and (2) advancing our understandings of the underlying mechanisms behind existing, commonly used algorithms. Below are some of the keywords that interest me:\nCurrently, I am investigating how Bayesian optimisation and active learning, in combination with physics-informed Gaussian processes surrogate models, can help engineers and oceanographers to better understand ocean currents and inform their exploration strategies."
